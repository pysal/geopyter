    "## Two Ways to Iterate \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we'll focus on the two most general ways to iterate (or repeat) a set of commands. The first approach is often called a _While Loop_ and in Python uses the the `while` reserved word with conditionals. The second approach is often called a _For Loop_ and in Python makes use of the `for` and `in` reserved words. \n",

    "\n",
    "Which approach you use usually depends on [what sort of data structure you are iterating over](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/920645/when-to-use-while-or-the-for-in-python) and [whether we know before we start how many times we want to repeat the commands](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/3bqzpf/python_for_loops_vs_while_loops/). That might sounds a little vague at this point, but it is something to come back to think about once you have a better understanding of how loops work.\n",

    "\n",
    "Using the `while` statement instead, as long as the condition evalutes to `True`, the block of code is run again and again and again and again....and again until some stopping condition is reached (usually the while condition becomes `True`).\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's take a deeper look:\n",
    "- First, we defined a variable named `myVariable` with a string of text as value.\n",
    "- Then we defined a variable `counter` and we assigned it the value of 1. \n",
    "- Then we used the `while` statement to check if the value of `counter` was less then 10. \n",
    "- Since that condition evaluated to `True`, we printed the value of `myVariable` and then added 1 to `counter`. \n",
    "- The indendented block of code was then run again and again by Python *until* the `while` statement returned a `False` (this happened because after several iterations the value of counter reached 11).\n",
    "- After that Python simply continued to execute the code outside the `while`*block* (i.e., the last line of non-indented code)\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental idea is thus: *while this condition holds, repeat the instruction*.\n",
    "\n",
    "A usually confusing step while learning loops, is the fact that the value of `counter` is increasing. Remeber that we are starting the instruction from the beginning of the *while block*. So the first time that we hit it, `counter` has value of 1 (because this is what we set it to outside the *while block* on the second line of non-indented code). But the second time the while conditional is evaluted, `counter` will be equal to 2, as we increased its value in the *while block*. At the beginning of the third iteration it will have thus value of 3, while at its end it will be incremented to 4. And so on...\n",

Depending on how well you understood the material above (and from previous notebvooks) you may or may not be able to work this one out. If not, don't worry, just try to understand the concepts above and hopefully in future you'll be able to come back and work it out. \n",
