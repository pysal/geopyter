    "Welcome to the eighth Code Camp notebook! In this lesson we'll cover *functions* in Python, a concept that you've already encountered but to which you've not yet been formally introduced. Now we're going to dig into this a little bit more because writing functions is where lazy programmers become good programmers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, as we saw with the concept of *iteration*, programmers are lazy and they tend want to avoid doing boring tasks over and over again. The idea is to avoid \"wasting time re-inventing the wheel\" and programmers have abbreviated this idea to the acronym **D.R.Y.** (Do not Repeat Yourself): if you are doing something more than once or twice, ask yourself if there's a way to encapsulate what you are doing in a function: you write the function _once_, and then _call_ it whenever you need to complete that task.\n",
    "\n",
    "![automate](img/automate_all_the_things.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Naturally, **D.R.Y.** has its opposite: **W.E.T.** (We Enjoy Typing or Write Everything Twice). Dry is nearly always better than wet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulating regularly-used bits of code in functions has several advantages:\n",
    "* Your code is more readable: because you only have to write a function once and can then re-use it as many times as you like, your files are shorter.\n",
    "* Your code is easier to maintain: because you only have to write a function once, if you find a mistake in your code, you also only have to fix it in one place.\n",
    "* Your can code more quickly: things that you do a _lot_ can even be stuck in a separate file that you _import_ into your code so that your most-used functions are immediately available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, a function is a way to _do_ something _to_ something in a portable, easy-to-use little bundle of code."

    "range(\n",
    "    len(myList)\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Python has to work from the 'inside-out': it needs to figure out what `len(myList)` does before it can figure out what `range(...)` should do, because it has to have the output from `len` before it can pass that as an input to `range`. There's nothing stopping you from writing this as:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "myLength = len(myList)\n",
    "print range(myLength)\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "## Layout of a Function\n",
    "\n",
    "As we briefly mentioned in notebook-5, any 'word' followed by a set of parenthesis is a function. The 'word' is the function's *name*, and anything that you write within the parantheses are the function's inputs (also known as *parameters*). Like so:\n",

    "So how do we create (*instantiate* in programming terms) a new function? Like everything else in Python, functions have specific rules that you have to follow for the computer to understand what you want it to do. In this case there are two separate steps: the *function definition* and the *function call*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a function definition:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def myFirstFunc():\n",
    "    print \"Nice to meet you!\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "Let's see what happened there:\n",
    "- We indicated that we wanted to _define_ (lazy version: `def`) a new function.\n",
    "- Right after `def` we gave the function a name: `myFirstFunc`.\n",
    "- After the new function's name there's the set of parenthesis and a colon.\n",
    "- The line(s) of the function are indented (just like a loop).\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for the indenting is the same as for a `while` loop or an `if` condition! It indicates to the Python interpreter that whatever is indented *belongs* to the function. Is like saying: \"Look man, I'm going to define this `myFirstFunc` function, and whatever is indented afterwards is part of the function\". That is what we call the *function's body*, and it's the full package of instructions that we want the computer to run every time we *call* the function. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Function Call\n",
    "\n",
    "Cool, now that we have defined a function how do we use it? \n",
    "\n",
    "The same that we did with `len` and `range`. We *call* it by just typing:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "myFirstFunct()\n",
    "```\n",
    "Try it yourself in the coding area below!"
