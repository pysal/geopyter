    "Welcome to the third Code Camp notebook! This lesson is all about learning to deal with the (unavoidable) errors that you wil encounter when programming in Ptyhon. Most programmers spend _most_ of their day dealing with errors of one sort or another: sometimes they are easy to solve (e.g. you mis-typed a variable name), other times they are very, very hard (e.g. you are writing a cloud computing platform and have to deal with competition for resources). Either way, learning how to find, diagnose, and resolve errors, as well as how to minimize their consequences, is thus a crucial skill for programmers. \n",

    "## Syntax Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "A Syntax Error is likely to the be the most frequent error you encounter when you're getting started. Syntax errors occur when the Python interpreter has trouble *[parsing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing)* your code. In other words, it can read what you've typed but it doesn't quite make sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a bit like when someone who doesn't speak your language fluently makes a mistake that to you seems funny, but to them is quite natural because they're extrapolating from what they know in a different language. Many English-speakers who are 'embarassed' by their level of Spanish are also apparently happy to inform Spanish-speakers that they are pregnant ('embarazada')! Or perhaps you think that the opposite of 'regardless' is 'irregardless'? These are natural mistakes, but they are 'errors' nonetheless. It's just that human beings – being smart – can figure out what you meant, while computers – being almost irredeemably stupid – cannot.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A simple typo\n",
    "In the first example for instance, the error consists in a misspelled `print` command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "File \"<ipython-input-6-9bf4eef14fd8>\", line 1\n",
    "    prnt \"Ouch!\"\n",
    "               ^\n",
    "SyntaxError: invalid syntax\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's read the error message together, from top-to-bottom: \n",
    "- First, the interpreter prints out the file name and the line number where it thinks the error can be found. In our simple case that's not a big deal since we only have two lines of code anyway, but if you had thousands of lines of code spread across dozens of separate files this could be a life-saver!\n",
    "- In addition, Python also prints the _actual_ line where it threw up its hands and said \"I can't read this!\" \n",
    "- It has even added a little 'caret' ( ‸ ) to try to point out where on that line it _thinks_ the error is. We wouldn't recommend that you study _only_ that bit of code (it pointed to 'Ouch!' after all, not to `prnt`) but it's not a bad place to start.. \n",
    "- Lastly, Python prints out vye clearly that the error is something to do with the syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "SyntaxError: invalid syntax\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

Can you check the network connection?\" So in Python, one part of the application can  'throw' an exception (\"Hey, I'm not online\") when it tries to download a file and then it's up to the application to _catch_ that problem and print a warning to the user.\n",
