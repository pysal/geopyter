    "### Lesson Content \n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the fifth Code Camp notebook! In this lesson we're going to explore two, more advanced *data types*. In previous weeks we looked at numeric (*integers* and *floats*) and textual (*strings*) data, but it's probably been quite difficult to imagine how you'd assemble these simple data into something useful. The new data types (lists and dictionaries) will _begin_ to show you how that can happen, and they will allow you to 'express' much more complex concepts with ease.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's the Difference?\n",
    "\n",
    "Up until now, our variables have only held _one_ thing: a number, or a string. \n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, we've got: `myNumber = 5` or `myString = \"Hello world!\"`. And that's it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, with **lists** and **dictionaries** we can store _multiple_ things: several numbers, several strings, or some mish-mash of both. This is much as you would with a _real_ dictionary (which holds the definitions of lots of words) or a _real_ list (which holds the things that you need to get done today).\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, the simple explanations in parentheses above encompass the main difference between lists and dictionaries:\n",
    "- A _list_ is an *ordered* collection of 'items' (numbers, strings, etc.). You can ask for the first item in a list, the 3rd, or the 1,000th, it doesn't really matter because your list has an order and it keeps that order.\n",
    "- A _dictionary_ is an *unordered* collection of 'items' (numbers, strings, etc.). You access items in a dictionary in a similar way to how you access a real dictionary: you have a 'key' (i.e. the word for which you want the definition) and you use this to look up the 'value' (i.e. the definition of the word).\n",
    "\n",
    "There's obviously a lot more to lists and dictionaries than this, but it's a good starting point: lists = ordered, dictionaries = unordered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with *lists* in this notebook and we'll continue with *dictionaries* in the following.\n",

    "So a *list* is an ordered collection of items that we access by position (what Python calls the _index_). So the first item in a list is always the first item in the list. End of (well, sort of... more on this later). Because lists are a new data type, we create and use them differently from the simple variables we've seen so far. You can always spot a list because it is a series of items separated by commas and grouped together between a pair of square brackets ( *[A, B, C, ..., n]* ).\n",

    "Appending to a list using `append(...)` is actually using something called a _function_. We've not really seen this concept before and we're not going to go into it in enormous detail here (there's a whole other notebook to introduce you to functions). The things that you need to notice at _this_ point in time are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. That square brackets ('[' and ']') are used for list indexing.\n",
    "2. That parentheses ('(' and ')') are (normally) used for function calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best thing about functions is that they are like little packages of code that can do a whole bunch of things at once (e.g. add an item to a list by modifying the list directly), but you only need to remember to write `append(...)`. \n",
    "\n",
    "What did I mean just now by 'modifying the list directly'? \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that in the first example above we had to write:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "myList = myList + ['New item']\n",
    "``` \n",
    "because we had to write the result of concatening the two lists together back to the variable. The list isn't really growing, we're just overwriting what was _already_ in `myList` with the results of the list addition operation. What do you think you would get if you wrote the following code:\n",

    "```python \n",
    "myList.append('New item')\n",
    "```\n",

    "## Other List Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "`append()` is a function, and there are many other functions that can be applied to lists such as: `range`, `len`, `insert` and `index`. You tell Python to *execute a function* (sometimes also termed *calling a function*) by writing the function's name, followed by a set of parentheses. The parentheses will contain any optional inputs necessary for the function to do its job. Appending to a list wouldn't be very useful if you couldn't tell Python _what_ to append in the first place!\n",
    "\n",
    "The functions `range` and `len` are also good examples of this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "len(theParty)\n",
    "range(theParty)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, the function `len` (lazy short-hand for _length_) is _passed_ `theParty` list as an input in order to do its magic. And `range` works the same way.\n",
    "\n",
    "The functions `append`, `insert` and `index` work a _little_ bit differently. They have to be _called_ using `theParty` list. We're at risk of joining Alice down the rabbit-hole here, so let's just leave it at: the second set of functions are of a particular _type_ known as *methods* of the *list class*. We'll stop there. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/files/2013/01/alice-falling-down-rabbit-hole1.jpg\" width=\"250\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use a _list method_ you always need to 'prepend' (i.e. lead with) the name of list you want to work with, like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "theParty.append(\"New Guest\")\n",
    "theParty.insert(2, \"Anastasia\")\n",
    "theParty.index(\"Sarah\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea here is that methods are associated with specific types of things such as lists, whereas generic functions are kind of free-floating. Think about it this way: you can't append something to a number, because that _makes no sense_. Appending is something that only makes sense in the context of a list. In contrast, something like `len` works on several different types of variables: lists and string both!"
