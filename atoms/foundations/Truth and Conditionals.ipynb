    "Boolean logic and [Boolean algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra) have to do with _set theory_ but also lie at the heart of the modern computer! Remember that in notebook 1 we saw that a computer works by combining `AND`, `OR`, `XOR` and `NAND` circuits to produce ever more complex calculations? Well, we also use this a lot in programming!\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python there are [three boolean logic opertors](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#boolean-operations-and-or-not), these are (in ascending order of priority): `or`, `and`, and `not`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll look at these in more detail in a second, but here's the 'cheat sheet':\n",
    "- OR: _if either A OR B are True_ then run the following code block...\n",
    "- AND: _if A AND B are True_ then run the following code block...\n",
    "- NOT: _if NOT(A) is True_ (where A is _False_) then run the following code block...\n",
    "\n",
    "It might help you to take a look at these Venn diagrams (source: [Wikimedia Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Vennandornot.svg)) that express the same three operations in graphical form. Imagine that _x_ and _y_ are both `conditions-to-test`... The left one is _AND_ because it is only the combination of _x AND y_ that is red; the centre one is _OR_ because it represents any combination of _x OR y_ being red; the rightmost is _NOT_ because it is the opposite of _x_ that iss red.\n",

    "The `and` operator (just like in plain English!) is used when two conditions must both be True at the same time. So it has _two_ arguments and returns `True` if, and only if (_iff_), both of them are `True`. Otherwise it returns `False`."
